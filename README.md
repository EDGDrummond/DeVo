# DeVo

This is a decentralised voting system built for secure, privacy-preserving participation amongst multiple anonymous parties. The decentralisation of the tallying procedure is a novel addition to voting infrastructure. Of particular interest is that this setup allows the MPC to use a single public key to publish the vote's result, to publish data on the voting chain from another chain using this public key, or publish on another chain using a distributed key.
